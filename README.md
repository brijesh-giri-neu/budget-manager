We use **GitHub Projects** to track:
- Feature development
- CI/CD tasks
- Bug reports and fixes

## CI/CD Pipeline (TODO)
> A CI/CD pipeline setup is planned using GitHub Actions to do the following:
- Perform Lint/static checks on pull requests
- Auto-build APKs on push to `main` 
- Publish APKs on the repository's releases page
